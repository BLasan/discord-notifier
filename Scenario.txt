Following operations will be performed from the script.

1. Send notifications to the google space if a thread is initiated.
2. It keeps the message in a map and periodically checks whether there's any reply for the thread. If so, it removes the
   corresponding thread from the map in order to avoid sending further notifications on that.
3. When initiating a thread, it comes with a message. In message object, we have property "position". If it's 0, then we won't
   perform delete operation as it's sent by a member.
